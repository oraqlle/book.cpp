# Project: Guessing Game

```admonish warning
üöß Page Under Construction! üèóÔ∏è
```

Let us jump straight into C++ by developing a project together! This will help expose you to some common concepts from C++ and how they are used in an actual program. You'll learn how create variables, control the flow of your program, take in user input, create functions and more! These concepts will be explored in more detail in future chapters while this one will focus on the fundamentals.

We'll be implementing a simple number guessing game. The program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). It will then prompt the user to type in a guess. After the guess is entered the program will indicate whether the guess was too high or to low or a congratulatory message if the user got it right and exit the program.

## Setting Up a New Project

To begin, create a new directory in your `projects/` directory called `guessing_game` and enter it.

```sh
$ mkdir guessing_game
$ cd guessing_game
```

As usual, we'll need to create the files `main.cxx`, `CMakeLists.txt` and `CMakePresets.json`. Our `main.cxx` file can just be an empty `main()` function like [Listing 2-1](#listing2-1) and for our `CMakeLists.txt` file we must specify a minimum project configuration detailed in [Listing2-2](#listing2-2). As for our `CMakePresets.json` file, we can use the either one from Chapter 1; [Listing 1-3](hello-cmake.md#listing1-3) or [Listing 1-4](hello-cmake.md#listing1-4).

<span id="listing2-1" class="caption">Listing 2-1: Empty `main()` function in `main.cxx`.</span>

```cpp
auto main() -> int {
    return 0;
}
```

<span id="listing2-2" class="caption">Listing 2-2: Simple 'CMakeLists.txt' for guessing game executable.</span>

```cmake
{{#include examples/guessing_game/CMakeLists.txt}}
```

## Processing a Guess

First we will need to we need to ask the user for input, process that input and ensure it is in a form we expected. To start we'll simply take in the users guess and return it to them. [Listing2-3](#listing2-3) shows the starting code.

<span id="listing2-3" class="caption">Listing 2-3: Code for obtaining an input from the user and printing it.</span>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

auto main() -> int
{
    std::cout << "Guessing Game!\n";

    std::cout << "Please input your guess (1..100): ";

    auto input = std::string {};

    std::getline(std::cin, input);

    std::cout << "You guessed: " << input << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Let's briefly go over the new concepts introduced in [Listing 2-3](#listing2-3). We have included a new header [`<string>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/string) which contains the definitions the type [`std::string`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string) and supported functions.

```cpp
#include <string>
```

We then prompt the user with the name of the game as well as request input from the user using the output stream `std::cout`, which we covered in Chapter 1.

```cpp
    std::cout << "Guessing Game!\n";

    std::cout << "Please input your guess (1..100): ";
```

### Storing Data with Variables

Next, we construct a new *variable* to store the users input in.

```cpp
    auto input = std::string {};
```

Now this is where things begin to get interesting. This line is an assignment expression which is used to bind a value to a variable. Here is another!

```cpp
auto boxes = int { 7 };
```

In C++ variables are mutable by default which means we are allowed to change it's value. THis concept will be discussed more in [Chapter 3 | Variables and Mutability](../common-concepts/vars-mut.md). To make a variable constant ie. its value cannot change once it is set, we use the `const` keyword before `auto`.

```cpp
const auto boxes = int { 7 };  // constant
auto crates = int { 4 };  // mutable
```

```admonish tip
The `//` syntax indicates a comment that continues until the end of the line. Everything in a comment is ignored by C++. You will learn more about them in [Chapter 3 | Comments](../common-concepts/comments.md).
```

In this case of our variable `guess` in our guessing game program, we have (default) constructed a temporary value with the type `std::string` which we then bind to the variable named `guess` using the `=` operator. We have also used `auto` to allow the compiler to deduce the type that the variable `guess` should have. We could have written explicitly the type on the left-hand-side instead of `auto` like the example below but this would be more verbose as we have to express the type twice. It also means that if we change the type on the RHS we must also change it on the LHS but with `auto` the compiler will do that for us!

```cpp
    std::string input = std::string {}; 
```

```admonish tip
When constructing our `std::string` we have used what is known as brace. This is a safer variant of regular construction (which uses parenthesis `()`) as it prevents narrowing which causes the bit representation of some types to be truncated. We also have default constructed our `std::string` which in this case means the `std::string` is constructed as an empty string not as an invalid object.
```

### Receiving User Input

There are a few different ways for handling user input from the terminal in C++. For this program we have used the [`std::getline()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/getline).

```cpp
    std::getline(std::cin, input);
```

This function extracts all characters from the first argument which is of type [`std::basic_istream<>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_istream). In this case, the input stream is [`std::cin`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/cin). Once no characters remain in the stream or the designated deliminator is encountered; which defaults to `'\n'` (third argument), the extracted characters are then written to the second argument which is a *reference* to a string of the same underlying character type. References allow functions to read and/or modify data passed to them and have the effects reflected on the callers side. We'll cover references and ownership in C++ during [Chapter 4](../ownership/ownership.md). In effect this function reads an entire line and copies the characters into a string.

## Printing with Output Streams

As we first saw in ["Hello, world!"](hello-world.md) we can output text using [`std::cout`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/couthttps://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/cout) global object using the operator [`<<`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_ostream/operator_ltlt). You may be wondering why the "unique" syntax for out has been chosen for printing? This is because the [Input/Output](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io) library is more generic than just a printing facility. As the name suggests it is a library for manipulating and using Input/Output (IO) streams. Streams can be thought of as a pipeline between two endpoints eg. a program and the terminal screen where data can be pushed from one end (the program) and extracted at the other end (the terminal screen). The C++ IO library uses streams to model how data is transferred between various endpoints like a program, the terminal screen, files etc. with the `<<` and `>>` operators being used to perform formatted IO ie. push formatted data to and/or extract formatted data from a stream respectively. These facilities were then used to wrap low level IO handles such as `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr`; which are used to print and take user input, in global stream objects eg. `std::cin`, `std::cout` and `std::cerr` which meant they could be manipulated using the same API and functionality provided by the standard C++ IO library.

```admonish note
The C++23 Standard includes a new header [`<print>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/print) with functions like `std::println()` which use the C++20 [formatting library](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/format) which make printing much more intuitive and faster. This library was directly inspired by the `{fmt}` library.
```

If you are familiar with other languages you may be wondering why `<<` is used to push to a streams as this operator is normally used for the [left bit shifting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#Bit_shifts) operations. We are able to use the `<<` operator because it has been overloaded. Essentially this means the functionality of `<<` has been changed and customized for particular types. Within the C++ standard library, `<<` has been overloaded to support taking a reference to a [`std::basic_ostream<>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_ostream) object as the left argument; ie. the type of `std::cout`, and various builtin C++ types and library types from the standard library as the right argument eg. `int` and `std::string`, which allows the `<<` syntax to be used with many different types already in C++. Overloading will be covered in more detail in [Chapter 3 | Functions](../common-concepts/functions.md).

In this program we have seen that we can chain the calls to `<<`.

```cpp
    std::cout << "You guessed: " << input << std::endl;
```

This is because each call to `<<` returns a reference to the same stream passed as the left argument, allowing you to make subsequent calls to `<<` one after another. This can make it easier to build up pipelines to and from streams as we can create arbitrarily long chains.

Finally, you may notice the `std::endl` at the end of the chain. This is a *stream manipulator*. Stream manipulators are used to modify the stream to support different kinds of formatting. In this case, `std::endl` simply appends a `'\n'` to the stream and flushes the underlying buffer. So why not just use `'\n'`? Well, you should. Using `std::endl` repeatedly just to add newlines will dramatically degrade performance because repeatedly flushing the internal buffer forces the OS the immediately display the characters instead of allowing for the output to buffer ie. reach a large enough size to warrant making a system call. `std::endl` should only be used when you want to flush the streams buffer and place a newline eg. at the end of a program, otherwise use an explicit `'\n'`.

## Generating a Secret Number

Now we want some way to generate a secret number that the player will try to guess. We also want the number to be different each time so the game is more fun but we'll keep it between 1 and 100 to ensure it is not too difficult. To generate our secret number we'll use a random number generator. The C++ standard library contains a header [`<random>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random) which contains a bunch of facilities for generating random numbers. Update your `main.cxx` file according to [Listing 2-4](#listing2-4).

<span id="listing2-4" class="caption">Listing 2-4: Added code to generate a random number.</span>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <random>
#include <string>

auto main() -> int
{
    std::cout << "Guessing Game!\n";

    auto rd = std::random_device {};
    auto gen = std::mt19937 { rd() };
    auto distrib = std::uniform_int_distribution<unsigned> { 1u, 100u };

    const auto secret_number = distrib(gen);

    std::cout << "The secret number is: " << secret_number << '\n';

    std::cout << "Please input your guess: ";

    auto input = std::string {};

    std::getline(std::cin, input);

    std::cout << "You guessed: " << input << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

First we include the new header `<random>` so we can access the (pseudo-) random number generation types. Next we add the lines

```cpp
    auto rd = std::random_device {};
    auto gen = std::mt19937 { rd() };
    auto distrib = std::uniform_int_distribution { 1, 100 };
```

The first line (default) constructs a new [`std::random_device`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random/random_device). This is a uniformly distributed, non-deterministic number generator. While we could generate a random number from simply calling `rd`, this is considered bad practice as `std::random_device` performance  degrades with use due to its entropy pool being used up. For this reason we simply use it to seed a proper Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG) such as [`std::mt19937`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random/mersenne_twister_engine) which is what we do on the second line. Finally we construct a [`std::uniform_int_distribution<>`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random/uniform_int_distribution) which is used to uniformly generate integers between the two provided bounds.

This sets up our random number generator. To obtain a random number we can call the distribution object, passing in the generator and returning a new random value.

```cpp
    const auto secret_number = distrib(gen);
```

## Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number

Next we want to compare our players guess to the secret number. The updated code can be seen in [Listing 2-5](#listing2-5).

<span id="listing2-5" class="caption">Listing 2-5: Added code to compare players input to the secret number.</span>

```cpp
#include <compare>
#include <iostream>
#include <random>
#include <string>

auto main() -> int
{
    std::cout << "Guessing Game!\n";

    auto rd = std::random_device {};
    auto gen = std::mt19937 { rd() };
    auto distrib = std::uniform_int_distribution { 1, 100 };

    const auto secret_number = distrib(gen);

    std::cout << "The secret number is: " << secret_number << '\n';

    std::cout << "Please input your guess: ";

    auto input = std::string {};

    std::getline(std::cin, input);

    auto guess = std::stoi(input);

    if (const auto cmp = guess <=> secret_number; std::is_eq(cmp)) {
        std::cout << "You guessed correctly!\n";
    } else if (std::is_lt(cmp)) {
        std::cout << "Too small!\n";
    } else if (std::is_gt(cmp)) {
        std::cout << "Too big!\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Before we are able to compare the players input to our secret number we must first convert the raw input into a number so they can be compared.

```cpp
    auto guess = std::stoi(input);
```

C++ offers a few functions for converting strings into numbers which all start with the prefix [`std::sto*`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/stol) meaning 'string-to' followed by a designator for the conversion type. Because we want to parse our input as a plain `int` we can use `std::stoi()`.

Next we compare the `guess` to our `secret_number`. Here we can make use of the spaceship operator (`<=>`) which allows us to perform a '3 way comparison' which we can then query with the utility functions [`std::is_eq`, `std::is_lt`, `std::is_gt` etc.](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/compare/named_comparison_functions). In this case we create a new object `cmp` and then use these 'named comparison' functions to check the result. We use [`if` and `else if`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/if) branches to test the comparisons result and run a separate piece of code if that branch succeeds.

```cpp
    if (const auto cmp = guess <=> secret_number; std::is_eq(cmp)) {
        std::cout << "You guessed correctly!\n";
    } else if (std::is_lt(cmp)) {
        std::cout << "Too small!\n";
    } else if (std::is_gt(cmp)) {
        std::cout << "Too big!\n";
    }
```

We have also used a initialiser statement in the first `if` branch. This allows us to run an expression at the start of the `if` branches and store the result in a local variable (in this case `cmp`) which can only be accessed within the `if` branches. This helps ensure that `cmp` is not modified or accessed outside the `if` branches it belongs to.
