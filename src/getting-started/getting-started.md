# Getting Started

To get started with C++ you will need a compiler that can turn your C++ source code into an executable. There are many compilers available regardless of what system your are on and many of the compilers can be found on many different systems. The choice of a compiler is largely dependant on the availability of the compiler and how well it meets your requirements. For the purpose of this book, the choice of compiler is irrelevant and will largely depend on teh former. For this book, the usage of GCC will be assumed for compiler flags, commands etc.

## Available C++ Compilers
