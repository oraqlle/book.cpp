# "Hello, Godbolt!"

## Compiling Online

The ability to quickly test and prototype software is extremely useful however, doing so in C++ is not so easy. There's a lot of steps that need to be taken to setup a project correctly which is good for building robust software but slows the speed of prototyping down to a halt. Luckily there exists a tool that makes this processes much easier. It is online C++ compiler known as Godbolt. This site allows you to compile C++ using many different compilers; even at the same time, as well as execute the resulting binary and even see the assembly generated from the compiler. It also allows you to share your session with others so they can see not only the code you wrote but the exact compiler(s), and flags you have set. It is a massively useful tool that is invaluable to the C++ community. Here is an [example "Hello, world!" on Godbolt](https://www.godbolt.org/z/oPsdebsrh) which shows the generated assembly as well as the output from the executed binary.
