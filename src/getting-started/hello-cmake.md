CMake is a third-party tool used to configure and build C++ projects. While there are other tools like CMake for configuring C++ compiler toolchains, CMake is the most ubiquitous within the C++ community. CMake allows use to define one or more targets that our project produces. Targets can be an executable, library, documentation or even testing. This allows a single project to build many different outputs for different platforms from a single source. Targets can also be consumed by other targets allowing more modular builds.
