# Structures

A structure or *struct* is a way to aggregate or group related data together while giving
each piece of data a distinct name, unlike tuples. We'll explore; in this chapter, how to
define and instantiate structs, access data and call special functions called *methods*
on instances of structs.

```admonish note
Variables of a struct care called *member variables* while functions are called methods.
Together, these form the *members* of the struct.
