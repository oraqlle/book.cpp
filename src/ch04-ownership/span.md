# The `span` and `string_view` types

## `string_view`

Often we want to reference only part of a `string`, in the past we would use
`string::substr()` however this would return a newly allocated `string` so in C++17 we
got `std::string_view` which is a reference to a series of characters however, it does
not *own* the characters. `string_view` has almost all the same operations as `string`
which makes it super versatile as a `string` substitute when needing to reference part of
a `string`.

```cpp
$#include <iostream>
$#include <string>
$#include <string_view>
// --snip--

auto main() -> int {
    auto s = std::string { "hello" };
    auto sv = std::string_view { s.data() + 1, 3 };

    std::cout << s << "\n";
    std::cout << sv << "\n";
    
$    return 0;
// --snip--
}
```

```admonish  note
The `string::data()` method is used to get the address of the first element in a `string`
thus we can use it to get the starting address of our substring by offsetting it by the
correct number of characters as seen above.
```

We can also use `string_view` to handle *string literals*, these are the strings we create
using double quotes (`""`). This makes string literals; which previously was just an
address to the character data, much easier to use and much closer to `strings`, with the
the constraint that you cannot modify this text.

```cpp
$#include <iostream>
$#include <string>
$#include <string_view>

using namespace std::literals;

auto main() -> int {
    auto sv1 = std::string_view { "hello" };
    auto sv2 = "bye"sv;

    std::cout << sv1 << "\n";
    std::cout << sv2 << "\n";
    
$    return 0;
// --snip--
}
```

```admonish tip
We can create `strings` and `string_views` from *string literals* using
*literal operators*. Literal operators are suffixes you attach to a literals; like the
`u` suffix to make an integer literal `unsigned`, that can be used to construct a custom
type from the literals. In this case, we can make a `string` or `string_view` using the
`s` or `sv` literal operators respectively. These are found in the namespace
`std::literals` which we expose globally in the line above `main()`.
```

## Spans

We can general this ntion of a view using the `std::span` type. Because `spans` are more
general than a `string_view` there are far fewer methods available however, they still
cover all you need when working with a generalised view (or *span*) of a contiguous
data structure.

`spans` are used for similar reasons to `string_view`, to easily accesses subslices of a
contiguous data structure (ie. a subarray) or to adapt C-arrays into a safer type.

```cpp
$#include <iostream>
$#include <array>
$#include <span>
$
$auto main() -> int {
    // --snip--

    auto a1 = std::array { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
    auto s1 = std::span { a1.data() + 1, 3 };

    int a2[] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }; // C-array
    auto s2 = std::span { a2 };
    
$    return 0;
$}
    // --snip--
```

```admonish danger
You don't need to worry about why C-arrays are unsafe for the purposes of
this book. In a nutshell C-arrays (and string literals for that matter) are very
primitive structures that do not provide any guards from misuse.

This has the benefit of allowing clever uses of the structures for the sake of
performance and optimization which can be a good thing for system languages especially
for the time period C came onto the scene however, when learning a system language guards
help ensure correct practices are followed and engrained early in your journey so they do
not become *footguns* in the future. This is why this book does not cover content from C
as C++ has given many safer alternatives for decades.
